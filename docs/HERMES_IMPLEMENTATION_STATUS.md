# Hermes Intelligence Layer — Implementation Status

Branch: `feature/hermes-intelligence-layer-m1`. Scope: **Milestone 1 only.** Mock-only, additive,
reversible. No production activation, no real providers, no Telegram, no voice.

## Implemented (Milestone 1)

| Component | Module | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestrator service boundary | `packages/hermes-orchestrator/orchestrator.js` | `runHermesWorkflow(input)` |
| Task normalization contract | `normalize.js` | validated `NormalizedTask`, reuses canonical ids |
| Task classifier | `classify.js` | domain/risk/complexity/urgency/capabilities (deterministic) |
| Capability/provider/agent registries | `registries.js` | typed interfaces; mock provider is the only enabled one |
| Policy-decision engine | `policy.js` | high-risk → blocked pending approval |
| Mock router | `route.js` | `RoutingDecision`; mock-only by construction |
| Mock workflow executor | `execute.js` | reuses the reviewed mock provider; refuses non-mock |
| Deterministic verifier | `verify.js` | gates completion and learning |
| Structured events + recorder | `events.js` | writes `task_events` + `hermes_workflow_steps` |
| Memory extractor (candidates) | `memory.js` | pending only; refuses unverified runs |
| Secret redaction layer | `redaction.js` | deep key- and pattern-based |
| Persistence | `store.js` + 6 `hermes_*` tables | redaction-on-write |
| Tests | `tests/hermes-orchestrator.test.js` | 7 tests, all passing |

## Intentionally deferred (later milestones)

- Real provider adapters (M2, dev-only, allowlisted, budgeted, no prod).
- DB-backed registries, scorecards, verified-outcome routing improvement (M3).
- **Memory promotion** (M3) — approval-gated; **no promotion path exists yet**.
- Memory retrieval service, memory-conflict handling (M3).
- Telegram/PWA/voice integration, dashboards, provider health/fallback (M4).
- Live approval persistence wiring for high-risk tasks (currently blocked, not queued).

## Guarantees in this milestone

- The existing `packages/hermes/hermes.js` task pipeline is unchanged.
- Only the credential-free mock provider can execute; real providers are registry-disabled.
- Memory candidates are always `status='pending'` and never promoted.
- Every persisted Hermes payload is redacted; no secret or env value is stored.
- Additive schema only; reversible by dropping the `hermes_*` tables and deleting the module.
